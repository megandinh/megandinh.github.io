Now we're a growing community of over 200 designers. </p>\n\n              <p>We are no strangers to the Cognitive Science department and their Design and Interaction curriculum. Call it Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-Centered Design (HCD), or \n              Interactive Design. Despite UCSD‚Äôs rich history in Cognitive Science and growing interest in the Design degree, we have a problem: Design is a sliver of CogSci.</p>\n\n              <p>Meaning, half of our efforts are devoted to interdisciplinary studies of ethnography, neuroscience, perception, data science, statistics, computing, and linguistics. \n              There‚Äôs advantages to a research-oriented degree program, but this feeds into insecurities of not feeling prepared to tackle the design industry and its evolving practices.</p>\n\n              <p>That‚Äôs why Design Co has GBMs, large-scale events, workshops, and panels. To find resources that live beyond the classrooms and let them thrive within the hands and minds of our community.</p>\n\n              <p2>Like any design challenge in the world, ours is to help our community members make progress towards their goals. This could look like:</p2>\n              <p2>- Introducing portfolios to new students so they don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed and ‚Äúbehind,‚Äù</p2>\n              <p2>- Sharing stories of alumni and fellow students to inspire, comfort, and connect each other,  and</p2>\n              <p>- Giving students the confidence to pursue design careers that are fulfilling to them.</p>\n\n              <p>We‚Äôre just students, so we can‚Äôt devote all of our time and efforts to grow the design community by ourselves. But, we‚Äôre also students. We bring a fresh perspective to how we interact with \n              design and use it as a tool to innovate and solve problems.</p>\n      </div>\n\n       <div id=\"tablerow\">\n            <div id=\"casetitle\">Tone and Voice</div>\n              <p>Design Co is playful, professional, and passionate.</p>\n              <p>Playful because we‚Äôre also students. We‚Äôre cool with using contractions, emojis ü•∞, and everyday language to communicate. Alliteration, hooks, suspense, and questions are welcomed. We echo the voices of the students, which can be excited, confused, hopeful, and curious.</p>\n              <p>Professional because we want to be trusted by others, especially industry partners. We are leaders, and we want our interactions with others to make lasting impressions and lead to more opportunities for our community.</p>\n              <p>Passionate because we care about the wellbeing and growth of our community. We are genuinely excited about the work we do because we believe that we can make waves within UCSD and in the greater design community.</p>\n      </div>\n\n       <p>.„Éª„ÄÇ.„Éª„Çú‚ú≠„Éª.„Éª‚ú´„Éª„Çú„Éª„ÄÇ.</p>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Designco;\n\n"],"names":["props","className","to","id","src","dco","alt","camp","spark","intern","fig","fall","cc"],"sourceRoot":""}
