We'll dive into some real-world examples of projects, companies, and organizations that excel in cross-cultural design, so you won't \n            want to pass up this opportunity to gain new perspectives on how you design!</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div id=\"tablerow\">\n            <div id=\"casetitle\">Context</div>\n              <p>We started in a tiny classroom in 2012. Now we're a growing community of over 200 designers. </p>\n\n              <p>We are no strangers to the Cognitive Science department and their Design and Interaction curriculum. Call it Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-Centered Design (HCD), or \n              Interactive Design. Despite UCSD’s rich history in Cognitive Science and growing interest in the Design degree, we have a problem: Design is a sliver of CogSci.</p>\n\n              <p>Meaning, half of our efforts are devoted to interdisciplinary studies of ethnography, neuroscience, perception, data science, statistics, computing, and linguistics. \n              There’s advantages to a research-oriented degree program, but this feeds into insecurities of not feeling prepared to tackle the design industry and its evolving practices.</p>\n\n              <p>That’s why Design Co has GBMs, large-scale events, workshops, and panels. To find resources that live beyond the classrooms and let them thrive within the hands and minds of our community.</p>\n\n              <p2>Like any design challenge in the world, ours is to help our community members make progress towards their goals. This could look like:</p2>\n              <p2>- Introducing portfolios to new students so they don’t feel overwhelmed and “behind,”</p2>\n              <p2>- Sharing stories of alumni and fellow students to inspire, comfort, and connect each other,  and</p2>\n              <p>- Giving students the confidence to pursue design careers that are fulfilling to them.</p>\n\n              <p>We’re just students, so we can’t devote all of our time and efforts to grow the design community by ourselves. But, we’re also students. We bring a fresh perspective to how we interact with \n              design and use it as a tool to innovate and solve problems.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div id=\"tablerow\">\n            <div id=\"casetitle\">Goals</div>\n              <p>Regardless of what the GBM covers, the design sprints tackle, the website displays, Design Co is here to make an impact on students and the broader design community.</p>\n\n              <p2><u>At the Personal Level</u></p2>\n                <p2>Comfortable: Students feel like they can be vulnerable to share their work and know that any feedback they receive is respectful.</p2>\n                <p2>Confident: Students feel like they can learn and grow, regardless of when are where they start from. They can be themselves and not feel pressured to compare themselves to others or conform.</p2>\n                <p2>Supported: Students feel like they matter. When they feel lost or stuck, they are not judged but met with compassion.</p2>\n                <p>Connected: Students feel like they’re not alone. They can meet other students to collaborate and encourage each other.</p>\n\n              <p2><u>At the Career Level</u></p2>\n                <p2>Resume: Students can understand what is unique about a design resume and how to make resumes that help them meet their specific goals.</p2>\n                <p2>Portfolio: Students can learn about and create portfolios that demonstrate their strengths and declare their presence in the design community. </p2>\n                <p2>Interviews: Students can communicate their thoughts and ideas to others.</p2>\n                <p2>Networking: Students can meet fellow students and alumni as well as industry designers and recruiters who can provide insights and opportunities. </p2>\n                <p>Experience: Students can use what they’ve created and learned at Design Co to prepare for internships, jobs, and/or organizations.</p>\n              \n              <p2><u>At the Community Level</u></p2>\n                <p2>Inclusive: Students feel welcomed to join Design Co and have equal access to resources. Events and opportunities to grow are open to all and do not bias towards or against specific identities. </p2>\n                <p2>Diverse: Students of all identities feel accepted, seen, and heard.</p2>\n                <p2>Equity: Students are met with support to meet their unique goals.</p2>\n                <p2>Respect: Students respect each other and do not engage in discrimination, dishonesty, and/or hostility.</p2>\n      </div>\n\n       <div id=\"tablerow\">\n            <div id=\"casetitle\">Tone and Voice</div>\n              <p>Design Co is playful, professional, and passionate.</p>\n              <p>Playful because we’re also students. We’re cool with using contractions, emojis 🥰, and everyday language to communicate. Alliteration, hooks, suspense, and questions are welcomed. We echo the voices of the students, which can be excited, confused, hopeful, and curious.</p>\n              <p>Professional because we want to be trusted by others, especially industry partners. We are leaders, and we want our interactions with others to make lasting impressions and lead to more opportunities for our community.</p>\n              <p>Passionate because we care about the wellbeing and growth of our community. We are genuinely excited about the work we do because we believe that we can make waves within UCSD and in the greater design community.</p>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Designco;\n\n"],"names":["props","className","to","id","src","dco","alt","camp","fig","intern","spark","fall","cc"],"sourceRoot":""}
