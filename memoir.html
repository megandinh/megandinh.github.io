          A teacher’s assistant for an elementary school teacher is a relatively straightforward role. Grade tests, input grades, read with the students, and make sure that no one runs with scissors. When I was in eight grade, I helped my old elementary school teacher with these tasks for an hour a day. I didn’t mind tracing thirty gingerbread men on construction paper. I also didn’t mind when the cheeky second-graders taunted me for being “shorter than them.” I did mind inputting grades into the computer. Constantly referring to the physical stack of papers and tediously scrolling through the roster to find the corresponding name scathed my eyes for half an hour. This mild annoyance was enough to spur me to devise a solution, a metaphorical eye drop if you will. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach was rather simple: I decided to memorize the first and last names of each student. As I graded papers, I would then sort them alphabetically by last name, in accordance with the online roster’s format. That way, I could input a stream of grades with continuous clicks of the “Enter” button. I successfully reduced the time to input grades and acquired more time to cut out the gingerbread men. Eventually, my teacher caught onto my secretive sorting. 
        </p>
        <p>
          She approached me one day and remarked at how quickly she could input grades. Each paper just “happened” to be in an impeccable order. I sheepishly confessed to my antics, but she simply laughed and thanked me for my work. Her simple words of gratitude made an impression on me. To me, sorting papers was another task that I could occupy myself with. It was a small way to save some time, but to her, it reduced some of the daily stresses of teaching. I believe that this is the heart of human-centered design. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My first exposure to human-centered design was brief, but memorable. Even before UI, UX, and HCI cycled through my vernacular, I knew that I wanted to involve myself in something that could elicit the same feelings that my teacher felt in other people. Yet, I was equally unsure of how to go about finding what career would be at the intersection of my interests and my experience as a teacher’s assistant. Whenever I reflected on my sorting story, my only conclusion was that I liked helping other people. Naturally, a naive high school student like myself would then come to the astonishing decision to pursue a career in medicine because it was the only way to help other people. My tunnel vision severely shallowed my scope of career interests.
        </p> 
        <p>
          I eventually recovered from my misdirection to medicine. It took one class to peak my interest in design, and a budding interest was all I needed to plunge myself into the field of design. In the winter of my freshman year at UCSD, I enrolled in an introductory design course as a part of my lower-division major requirements. At the same time, I was becoming more resentful of the pre-med requirements because I was itching to take more interactive courses that did not require a lab manual. As a result, design felt more compelling to me than chemistry. I further severed my bonds with chemistry and the pre-med route when I was exposed to IDEO’s redesign of the shopping cart. I was reminded of how I helped my elementary school teacher, but I regarded my sorting story from the perspective of a designer. I was happy to help my teacher with grading, but I was equally enthralled by trying a new approach to grading. I took pride in redesigning a system of inputting grades after observing problems with the original method. I felt satisfaction from optimizing my interaction with the computer. These sensations that I could not articulate before became more apparent from a designer’s perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          That design course was a catalyst for my growing involvement with UCSD’s burgeoning design community. During my internship-less summer before sophomore year, I took an interactive design course on Coursera to continue learning and practicing design principles. When I returned in the fall, I became an undergraduate researcher at the Design Lab where I currently study how the coordination between people and automation can be optimized. Concurrently, I enrolled in several project-based courses to collaborate with equally motivated students. I am quite fond of my incessant interactions with UCSD’s design community, but I am especially proud of my experience as an instructional assistant for the same class that propelled me to this point. 
        </p>
        <p>
          An instructional assistant for a design course is a relatively straightforward role. Grade projects, input grades, answer questions, and hold office hours. I worked with my fellow teaching staff to lead studios of over 50 students, and one of my responsibilities was to create Kahoots that reviewed lecture material. Studios were two hours long, so both the staff and the students shared a mutual fatigue in concentration and motivation. Kahoots were an opportunity to warm up the class, so I revised the questions from past quarters to create questions that challenged students to apply design principles to real-world situations. For fun, I sprinkled in the names of the teaching staff in the questions. As a result, I witnessed an increase in discussions amongst students and more smiles than ever at staff meetings. I enjoyed deliberating over how to embed another IA’s name in a gulf of evaluation question, but I was even more pleased to see that my small efforts could soften the fatigue of studio time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The culmination of my experiences as a teacher’s assistant and a design student was understanding that human-centered design is a deliberate act of kindness. Most people are familiar with random acts of kindness: expressing gratitude towards someone, doing volunteer work, or complimenting someone. They are intended to encourage people to think about others and try something new. As an interaction designer, I will actively learn about what people need and approach their problems with a broad perspective, so I can deliver <strong style="color: #756254; font-weight: normal; font-family:'Judson'">a deliberate act of kindness</strong>.</p>
