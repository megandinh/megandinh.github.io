        <p><a style="color:#086788" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/FXkvfLaD9JfWmGzsmIhkt6/A4-Final-Prototype?scaling=scale-down&node-id=21%3A313">Les études</a> is an app that improves the social collaboration and engagement that is lost in remote learning for K-12 students by connecting them to college-student tutors. 
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>With enforced stay-at-home orders to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, students must acclimate to a remote learning environment to keep up with their education. However, the transition to remote learning poses challenges, such as lack of motivation and social interaction, that can hinder a student’s ability to learn. Furthermore, younger students (K-12) may struggle to find help with school work if their parents are essential workers with less time in the day to spend with their children.</p> 

        <p>Social interaction is a critical component of learning. This is especially important for K-12 students who rely on social interaction and communication to enhance their understanding of lessons. Remote learning deprives students of this interaction: less socialization with peers and reduced communication with teachers.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <br>
        <p><b>K-12 students need to stay on top of their school work to maintain a good academic standing, but this can be a challenge in itself with all of the stressors associated with remote learning.</b>
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>Given the remote learning environment, we conducted online secondary research pertaining to the topic of remote education and work. From this <a style="color:#086788" href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/">research</a>, we found that remote learning has the potential to effect new, more effective learning methods, but the current format of remote learning, which involves ill-prepared attempts to quickly adapt to the remote environment, is neither accommodating nor effective to students. 
        </p>
        <p>Further research in online communities like Reddit and Facebook indicated a collective struggle amongst students regarding <b>reduced communication</b> with peers and teachers, <b>loss of routine</b>, dwindling motivation and concentration, and overall <b>frustration</b> with remote learning.
        </p>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Surveys and Interviews</p>
        <p>To gain more insight into how students are coping with the changes in learning, we distributed a survey to our targeted audience of K-12 and college students. We found that <b>26/30</b> participants felt some <b>decline in their productive levels upon transitioning from in-person learning to remote learning</b>.
        </p>
        <img src="images/research.jpg" class="responsive center">
        <p>We then <b>contacted individuals</b> who were willing to elaborate more on their remote learning experience through an interview. Interviewees consisted of both <b>college students and a K-12 student</b>. Listed below are some of our interviewees’ perspectives on remote learning:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding: 5px 50px 10px;"> 
          <li style="color:#086788"><b>Parents are essential workers</b></li>
          <dd>“I have a younger brother who needs help with Spanish, but I can’t be much help because my Spanish is not fluent. Our parents are also essential workers, so <b>there’s no one who can help him practice speaking Spanish</b>.” - College student A</dd>
          <li style="color:#086788"><b>Remote Learning Routine</b></li>
          <dd>“The only problem is that I <b>cannot interact with my classmates.</b> I cannot make friends. - College student B</dd>
          <dd>“I do not feel organized because there is so much to catch up on. It's hard to navigate through everything. I believe the expectation of remote learning has increased more as professors assigns more work for us.” - College student C</dd>
          <li style="color:#086788"><b>Remote learning compared to in-person learning</b></li>
          <dd>“[Learning is] not as engaging through Zoom. [I] can <b>easily space out and get distracted</b> by things in house whereas if I were in an actual classroom, the teacher would probably notice that I was spaced out and snap me out of it.” - K-12 student</dd>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Key Findings</p>
        <p>From our interviews, we found that regardless of grade level, students <b>collectively struggle with finding motivation</b> to pay attention in classes and finish school work. This <b>supports our findings</b> from our online secondary and community research. Moving forward, we wanted to <b>find a way for students to feel supported in their academics</b> by focusing on how we can <b>improve the interactions</b> between students and in student-teacher communication.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>We chose to <b>focus on tutoring apps</b> because remote learning is not very conducive for peer-to-peer and student-to-teacher interactions. Tutoring can create <b>more engaging and collaborative learning environments</b> that help students <b>feel accountable for their academics</b> and <b>develop a rapport</b> with fellow student tutors who may be more understanding of the student’s circumstances.
        </p>
        <img src="images/compa.png" class="responsive center">
        <p>From our competitive analysis, we found that only one platform (K12) offers some form of <b>group tutoring</b>.  We want our app to incorporate group tutoring because there are <a style="color:#086788" href="https://ctet.royalroads.ca/students-benefit-learning-groups">benefits to group learning</a>, such as increased engagement with material and a solidified understanding of said material. Our app would allow students to work with their friends and peers <b>under the guidance of a tutor to enhance collaboration</b>. There are also very few platforms that offer an <b>offline Q&A service</b>, which is important to ensuring that students can still receive help even after tutoring sessions.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>After consolidating the data from user research and our competitive analysis, we created two personas to reflect our main stakeholders: K-12 students and college students.
        </p>
        <img src="images/personacs.png" class="responsive center">
        <p><b>We believe that these personas reflect our problem statement and findings</b> because a K-12 student wants to keep up with their education, but their motivation to do so might be hindered by the environment of remote learning. Thus, their <b>main motivation for using our app</b> would be to regain the benefits of collaborative learning.
        </p>
        <img src="images/personahs.png" class="responsive center">
        <p>Likewise, college students want to stay on top of their education, but external stressors like lost jobs can affect their learning abilities. <b>Our app would give college students a flexible way</b> to tutor in K-12 subjects that they have mastered to reduce financial stress.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Storyboards</h2>
        <p>With our main stakeholders in mind, we created storyboards to further explore where our potential app could be integrated within the user’s course of action.  
        </p>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Storyboard 1</p>
        <img src="images/sb1.png" class="responsive center">
        <p>This storyboard focuses more on <b>how a K-12 student can be academically supported by a tutor</b> to gain more motivation to do well in class and work with her tutor. 
        </p>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Storyboard 2</p>
        <img src="images/sb2.png" class="responsive center">
        <p>This storyboard focuses on <b>how college students can use their education to help other students</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Key Findings</p>
        <p>We presented our storyboard to our targeted audience for feedback. Our storyboards resonated with all four of our interviewees who could relate to the struggle of balancing school obligations with environmental and personal factors, such as distractions or bills. They <b>identified our potential solution as</b> a platform for students to reach out to tutors to help them with their remote learning experiences. There was also <b>concern about how tutors would be verified</b> of their qualifications to tutor, so we iterated on these storyboards to include more details about how a tutor can be verified.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Lo-fi Prototypes</h2>
      <p>We each created a paper prototype that emphasized themes of collaboration and engagement. 
      </p>
        <p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Paper Prototypes 1 & 2</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="images/wire1.jpg" class="responsive center">
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="images/wire2.jpg" class="responsive center" style="width:50%">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><b>Left:</b> The main point of this prototype is the ability to easily access video calls and chat rooms, which allow collaborative interaction with digitally uploaded materials. <b>It was inspired by</b> one interviewee’s frustration with having to use different links to enter Zoom meetings and no apparent way to interact with material besides screen share.
        </p>
        <p><b>Right:</b> This prototype sports a minimal layout with an ability to submit questions in multiple mediums for user freedom. <b>It was inspired by</b> our secondary research and interviewees who claimed that Zoom’s interface was confusing and difficult to use.
        </p>
        <p>When we reconvened, we created a digital lo-fi prototype that <b>used the key components</b> of each paper prototype: <b>shareable materials, simple interface, reward system, tutor-student rapport, and a question forum</b>.</p>
        <img src="images/lofi1.png" class="responsive center">
        <p>To address the concerns about tutor qualifications, we also incorporated an extensive tutor application in the sign-up process.</p>
        <img src="images/lofi2.png" class="responsive center">
      <br>
      <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p>We conducted user testing on our prototypes remotely using Figma. Users were given the <b>task</b> of creating an account, joining a tutor session, and checking the question forum. Afterwards, all five users noted that the overall app felt cohesive and conducive to a collaborative remote-learning environment. However, two users had issues with some of our features:
        </p>
        <img src="images/utest.png" class="responsive center" style="width:60%">
        <p><b>Left:</b> When filling out the availability on one’s profile, there is very little room on the screen to fill out the given calendar.
        </p>
        <p><b>Right:</b> Our app has several functionalities that might not be apparent to the user without browsing the hamburger menu. 
        </p>
        <p>Although we initially strived for a simple layout, we also had to consider the critical functions of our app. Given all of our app’s features, we found that users will have <b>difficulty navigating our app</b> if we continue to <b>neglect the size limitations</b> of the screen. We also found that prefacing our app with the context of being a “tutoring app” <b>may not provide users with enough information</b> to use the app. 
        </p>
        <p>Our <b>next step</b> was to <b>refine the functionality</b> and layout of the screens for better user flows and <b>create an onboarding screen</b> to ease users into our app.
        </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Alternate Designs</h2>
        <p>We gained additional feedback from user testing with five K-12 students who helped us refine the functionality of our app. They found the onboarding pages informative, but they <b>confirmed our suspicions</b> about the functionality of the app.</p>
        <img src="images/ad1.png" class="responsive center" style="width:60%">
        <ol> 
          <li><b>Tutor Sessions</b></li>
          <dd>- We merged the tutor session page onto the dashboard because user testing revealed that most users consulted with the dashboard first to check for an important feature like joining a tutor session.</dd>
          <li><b>Payments</b></li>
          <dd>- We omitted this feature from the app because the main users of this version of the app would be K-12 students, as opposed to parents and tutors. A couple users expressed discomfort with seeing payments, and the payments negated the overall feeling of collaboration and rapport that our app tries to uphold.</dd>
          <li><b>Logout</b></li>
          <dd>- The logout function was originally on the profile page, which was not intuitive for users and took a couple minutes to find. To expedite this process, we included it on the hamburger menu.</dd>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/ad2.png" class="responsive center">
        <ol> 
          <li><b>Tutoring Session Schedule</b></li>
          <dd>- We merged the tutoring sessions with the calendar view to create a quicker way to contact a tutor. This redesign also spaces out the information presented on the screen to avoid clutter. The <b>downside</b> with this redesign is that tutor sessions are not presented in chronological order like the original schedule view. We tried to remedy this with red warnings that notify users of upcoming sessions.</dd>
          <li><b>Challenges</b></li>
          <dd>- Rather than cluttering the dashboard with different features, we created a yellow challenge button for each tutor to quickly access the challenge page if needed. That way, challenges for each tutor are spatially and functionally separated from each other, which was ambiguous in the original design.</dd>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/ad3.png" class="responsive center">
        <ol> 
          <li><b>Availability Calendar</b></li>
          <dd>- In our first iteration with filling out one’s availability, we explored options outside of a calendar view and created separate time pickers for each day. However, further user testing revealed that users preferred calendar views. We redesigned our original wireframe of the availability selector by allowing the user to tap and drag times, one day at a time vs through the whole week.</dd>
          <li><b>Profile Availability</b></li>
          <dd>- When the user completes their availability in (1), their profile will display both a daily and weekly availability calendar, which can be used to schedule meetings with tutors.</dd>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/ad4.png" class="responsive center" style="width:80%">
        <ul> 
          <li><b>Points System</b></li>
          <dd>- We changed the points system from a shop system - points are currency and each item in the shop was worth a certain amount - to an achievement system - points are accumulated and unlock items at certain milestones. We found that users would be more willing to save points for the 100 point reward, which would make the rewards of lesser value less appealing. The achievement system also does better at motivating users to work towards a goal, such as getting a free tutor session.</dd>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/ad5.png" class="responsive center">
        <ol> 
          <li><b>Recent Questions</b></li>
          <dd>- One way to receive points is to answer questions. Therefore, to distinguish different users who ask and answer questions, we added more identification to question posts. That way, if a student chooses to answer a question, they will be identified as such and the validity of their answer will be verified by upvotes and tutors. </dd>
          <li><b>Post Questions</b></li>
          <dd>- Similar to the dashboard, we wanted to avoid cramming features on a single screen. For better accessibility, we created an add button at the top of the new question forum, which navigates to a new screen for posting questions.</dd>
        </ol>
      <br>
      <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <img src="images/hifi.png" class="responsive center" style="width:110%">
      <br>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>As a member of the Les Etudes team, I learned how the ambition to include an extensive amount of functionality to the app is achievable, but this requires consideration of the screen dimensions. I appreciated how my teammates and I embodied the attitude of “Start early, Start often.” If I were to redo the entire process, I would try to assess the other relationships between COVID-19 and education and how other platforms besides interactive tutoring can appease the concerns of educators specifically.</p>
      <p><b>If given more time and resources</b>, we launch this app into the app store and observe how students engage with remote learning. With news of summer and fall classes continuing the practices of remote learning, we would be interested in learning how students will further acclimate to this remote environment. <b>If students can reclaim a greater locus of control and develop sustainable learning habits by using our app, we would consider our app successful.</b>
