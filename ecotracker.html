			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<!-- <p class="bold" id="alink" style="font-size: 2vw; text-align: center;"><a href="https://a10-eco-tracker.herokuapp.com/">eco tracker</a> -->
				<p><span style="display: block"><b>Scope</b>   <span style="background-color: #84d984">User Research</span>   <span style="background-color: #84d984">UI/UX Design</span>   <span style="background-color: #84d984">Full-Stack Development</span></span>

				<p><a style="color:#6ab86a" href="https://a10-eco-tracker.herokuapp.com/">eco tracker</a> is an app that motivates people to track their daily commute, food, and waste data by quantifying their data into emission summaries that communicate a person’s progress towards their personal eco goals. 
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>Global warming. Pollution. Wildfires. The severity of environmental issues is continuously escalating with the current interactions between people and the environment. Most people are equipped with “Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle” in their arsenal, but where do they go from there? Starting the transition to a more eco-friendly lifestyle can be challenging.</p>
				<p>Suppose someone decides to ride their bike to work instead of driving. It’s a fairly simple substitute that can be implemented immediately. There are also the incentives to reduce carbon emissions and save money. However, a week goes by, but they are unsure of how much carbon emissions they reduced. “Did I even reduce my carbon footprint? What’s the point of riding my bike if it seems like no one else is saving the environment?” The transition to a more eco-friendly lifestyle can be challenging because people can lose motivation if they do not have a tangible way of seeing their progress towards their goals.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
			<br>
				<p>People who are trying to reduce their carbon footprint need to find ways to implement eco-friendly habits and reflect on their progress, but <b>the motivation to maintain these habits can dissipate</b> if they cannot determine whether they are making a difference or not.
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Needfinding</h2>
				<p>We first explored the current options for our targeted audience to determine how we can address the current gaps. Listed below are four apps that are typically used in relation to tracking carbon footprints or helping the environment.
				</p>
				<ul style="padding: 5px 50px 10px;"> 
				  <li><a style="color:#6ab86a" href="http://www.hashtagclimate.org/">#climate</a> is a social platform that <b>suggests actions based on the user’s interest</b> and encourages users to share these actions to social media.
				  </li>
				  <li><a style="color:#6ab86a" href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">Carbonfootprint.com</a> <b>alculates carbon emissions based on user input</b> from various categories such as commute and utilities.
				  </li>
				  <li><a style="color:#6ab86a" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/">Google Sheets</a> can <b>track innumerable logs of data</b>, and the user can apply formulas to calculate carbon emissions.
				  </li>
				  <li><a style="color:#6ab86a" href="https://www.dropcountr.com/">Dropcountr</a> provides <b>daily, monthly, and yearly trend summaries</b> of one’s water usage and allows the user to budget water usage accordingly.
				  </li>
				</ul>
				<img src="images/needfind.png" class="responsive center">
				<p>With all of this to consider, we wanted to create a mobile interface that is accessible to anyone who wants to pursue an eco-friendly lifestyle. <b>Accessibility</b> and <b>ease of use</b> is <b>important for us</b> because beginners to eco-friendly lifestyles might avoid apps that require several complex steps. Also, given the specialization of each app, there is <b>no app that centralizes all of these features</b>. This means that one might <b>need to consult with multiple apps to track</b> their progress, which can be time consuming and <b>demotivating</b>. 
				</p>
				<p>An eco-friendly lifestyle is a commitment, but it shouldn’t be a burdensome <b>time commitment</b>. We sought to find a way to merge the features of these resources to <b>create an app that centralizes key actions</b> - log data, receive daily reports, visualize quantified data, learn ways to reduce carbon emissions.
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>User Personas</h2>
				<p>After consolidating the data from user research, we created two personas to <b>solidify the core motivations and frustrations</b> for people who are trying to reduce their carbon footprint. We believe that <b>these personas reflect our problem statement and findings</b> because the process of reducing one’s carbon footprint can feel like a tedious commitment, regardless of experience or interest with it.
				</p>
				<img src="images/persona.png" class="responsive center">
			<br>
			<h2>Storyboards</h2>
				<p>With the key motivations and frustrations of our targeted audience pinpointed, we created two storyboards to further explore where our potential app could be integrated within the user’s course of action. </p>
			<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Storyboard 1: Beginning an eco-friendly lifestyle
			</p>
				<img src="images/storyboard2.jpg" class="responsive center"  style="outline: black solid 3px">
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 10px;">This storyboard <b>focuses more on the beginner</b> with little knowledge of carbon footprints, but another critical part to motivating the user would be to <b>optimize</b> the way that the user records and tracks their data or progress towards their goals. 
				</p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Storyboard 2: Maintaining an eco-friendly lifestyle
				</p>
				<img src="images/storyboard1.jpg" class="responsive center"  style="outline: black solid 3px">
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 10px;">This storyboard<b> focuses on reducing the time</b> to log data and see trends in data. This should <b>motivate users like Jim</b> to track meals more often because it feels less like a chore. He can also gain insights about his eco-habits that he may not have noticed from simply logging his data into a spreadsheet.
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Paper Prototypes</h2>
				<p>Storyboards aside, my team and I continued working with paper to create two different low-fidelity prototypes that offered <b>key features like creating goals, tracking data, viewing tips, and receiving a daily summary of carbon emissions</b>. These features were intended to motivate the user to maintain their eco-friendly habits by <b>letting them focus on logging their data</b>, while <b>the app would explain</b> what their data means <b>and visualize their progress</b> towards their goals. </p>
				<p>At this stage of the design process, we wanted to focus on how we could facilitate the interactions between the user and the app. To test this, we conducted multiple heuristic evaluations with users.</p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Prototype A: Focus on Logging and Emission Summaries</p>
				<img src="images/pp1.png" class="responsive center">
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 10px;">The interface of this prototype organizes features with five different tabs on a navigation bar. This prototype <b>encourages people to log commute data</b> by providing options to input the mode of transportation and number of miles traveled. There are also <b>daily and monthly emission summaries</b> that help users understand their data over a span of time.</p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 10px;">Prototype A is best suited for <b>users like Jim</b> (one of our personas) who might struggle to visualize their data and need a way to see patterns in their behavior. This prototype provides the breakdown of a user’s carbon emission based on the available categories: commute, food, energy, and waste. The monthly summary also visualizes the trends in carbon emissions for a user, with varying colors that represent high, medium, and low levels of carbon emissions. </p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Prototype B: Focus on Quantifying Data</p>
				<img src="images/pp2.png" class="responsive center">
				<!-- <div class="row">
					<div class="column">
						<img src="images/pp2.jpg" class="responsive center">
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<img src="images/pp21.jpg" class="responsive center">
					</div>
				</div> -->
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 10px;">The interface of this app <b>condenses the features</b> on a single home screen that the user can scroll through. This prototype shows how progress is made towards each goal that the user makes and <b>quantifies their data into real-world resources</b>, such as how many trees are theoretically saved. </p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 10px;">Prototype B is best suited for <b>users like Kim</b> (another persona of ours) who need constant reminders of their progress towards their goals. The progress bars for each goal on the home page can motivate the user to keep up their momentum with their daily eco=habits. Furthermore, the app’s feedback of the resources saved <b>can help the user understand how their actions have a direct impact on the environment</b>. </p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Heuristic Evaluations </p>
				<p>For <b>Prototype A</b>, we found that people were confused with the <b>option to log waste</b> because users had to input the weight of the waste. This was a poor match between the system and the real world, and we were suggested to measure waste in the number of waste used. Similarly, the option to log energy was also unclear because users would have to track how long they use electricity, which could be tedious. </p>
				<p>For <b>Prototype B</b>, we found that people were confused with the “Add Goal” page, which contained <b>too much information</b> on the screen. We believe that this page did not deliver a clear path to follow, so it was not very intuitive to the users.</p>
				<p>From here, we concluded that users need <b>realistic ways to track data</b> without spending too much time on it. Prototype A felt more efficient in organizing and presenting information to users, so we retained the layout of this prototype for better user interactions. Our <b>next step</b> was to refine how users will input their data because this is their main interaction with the app. Therefore, it should be simple and quick to do, so they can spend more time reviewing their daily summary and goal progress.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
				<p>Given our feedback from the heuristic evaluations, we decided to <b>remove the option to log energy</b> because we could not find an efficient way for the user to manually track energy. Furthermore, our feedback indicated that there was little interest in tracking energy to begin with. From our paper prototypes, we also redesigned how food and waste data would be logged.</p>
				<img src="images/wireframe1.png" class="responsive center">
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 0px;"><b>Daily Summary (Home Page):</b> Eco-habits are quantified as carbon emissions. The outer circle is color-coded to alert the user of their current score performance.</p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px;"><b>Monthly Summary:</b> A calendar will display past records of daily emissions.
				</p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 10px;"><b>Log Data:</b> Contains the main actions that user will take: logging commute, food, and waste data.
				</p>
				<img src="images/wireframe2.png" class="responsive center">
				<p style="padding: 15px 30px 0px;"><b>Log Commute:</b> Input transportation mode and miles traveled</p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px;"><b>Log Food:</b> Input number of times meat is consumed</p>
				<p style="padding: 0px 30px 0px;"><b>Log Waste:</b> Input number of times single-use plastic is used. We replaced the original option of logging the weight of waste with this new feature because users would have a better recall with single use plastic than weighing waste. 
				</p>
			<br>
			<h2>User Testing</h2>
				<p>The wireframes guided the front-end development of our app, which was ready for more user testing. We fleshed out an interview guide and gave users a task to follow. Their goal was to <b>work towards having a smaller carbon footprint</b> by making an eco-friendly goal and find a way to <b>track the progress</b> towards this goal. We were interested in three questions:</p>
				<ol style="padding: 5px 50px 30px;"> 
				  <li>Is the flow / layout of the app <b>intuitive</b> enough to navigate without hesitation?</li>
				  <dd>- This question would help us understand the user’s mental model and how we can bridge it with the system image.</dd>
				  <li>Does the user <b>feel motivated</b> to actually continue logging and feel they are making a change?</li>
				  <dd>- This is the main goal of our app, and we wanted to know if our app succeeds in doing so or how we can improve the app to reach this goal.</dd>
				  <li>How <b>satisfying</b> is seeing the daily/monthly progress?</li>
				  <dd>- The app should effectively present information to the user to help them maintain their eco-friendly lifestyle, and we want to know if our app succeeds in doing so.</dd>
				</ol>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">User Testing #1</p>
				<img src="images/utest1.jpg" class="responsive center">
				<p><span style="display: block"><b>Left:</b> Alex accidentally goes to the add page to add a goal rather than going to the goal page. This is a mistake and a clear mental model was not conveyed.</span>
				<span style="display: block"><b>Right:</b> Alex sees that the circle has changed colors to indicate that his emissions are high. However, he does not feel bad about it and does not feel any urge to fix this score. </span>
				</p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">User Testing #2</p>
				<img src="images/utest2.jpg" class="responsive center">
				<p><span style="display: block"><b>Left:</b> This is the tips screen after attempting to scroll down to the bottom. Without placing and holding your finger down on the page, John is unable to see the rest of the elements on the bottom of the page. </span>
				<span style="display: block"><b>Right:</b> John is sliding his finger from left to right across the page in order to recover from the mistake he made when pressing the incorrect icon. Because there is no obvious back button, he spent some time confused on how to return to the add page.</span>
				</p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">A/B Testing</p>
				<p>For our A/B testing, we wanted to test out different interfaces on the log commute data page. We proposed two ways for users to input their distance traveled. Version A contains <b>a slider</b> that is <b>simple to use and more interactive, but it is <b>limited to a max input</b> of 100 miles. Version B is a <b>text box</b> that allows for an <b>infinite range</b> of numerical input, but it may <b>take longer to use</b> because it requires interactions with a keyboard.</p>
				<img src="images/abtest.png" class="responsive center" style="width:80%">
				<br>
				<p>We justified our A/B testing with the argument that both versions seem equally effective for inputting data.  Both designs are different enough to observe a possible difference in the responses that they elicit.</p>
				<p>We used Google Analytics to track the number of clicks to the save button, as well as the time spent on the add page. This will allow us to see which version is more efficient, as the page with less time spent on it will likely be quicker and more efficient for the user to log data. </p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Google Analytics</p>
				<img src="images/analyze.png" class="responsive center">
				<br>
				<p>Version A (/commute) produced 44 page clicks with an average time of 46 seconds while Version B (/viewAlt) boasted 67 page clicks with an average time of 27 seconds. Other feedback from users included <b>expressed frustration around the slider bar in Version A</b>, since the screen often did not recognize the user was trying to move the pointer along the bar, and the whole screen was pushed to the side.</p>
				<p>From this, data we can see how <b>Version B was both faster for users to use and more successful</b> in getting users to complete their given task. This could be due to the imprecision of the sliding bar, as the slightest of movement or “slide” resulted in about a 4 miles increase or decrease in either direction. For this reason, users may have had to spend more time to accurately slide the pointer into the correct position to count the precise amount of miles driven.</p>
				<p class="bold text-center" style="font-size: 25px">Key Findings and Plan for Next Step</p>
				<p>After user testing, we determined three key findings:</p>
				<ol style="padding: 5px 50px 10px;"> 
				  <li>The user <b>could not identify the markers and identifiers</b> used in our app, specifically the “L” on the summary page and the “Add” on the navbar.</li>
				 <!--  <dd>- There is very little information on the summary page, or even the app in general, about what each element means. As a result, the users’ mental model clashed with the conceptual model, so users did not know what to do with the information presented with them.</dd> -->
				  <li>The user <b>did not feel extremely motivated by the numbers</b> on the summary page</li>
				 <!--  <dd>- There is not a lot of context on this page, and the user is not quite sure how their number compares with others. This causes them to feel distant and they don’t feel any empathy since the numbers seem arbitrary to them.</dd> -->
				  <li>The user was confused whenever they were confronted with errors and could not recover from them.</li>
				  <!-- <dd>- This is seen when the user accidentally clicks on a button and has no way of returning to the previous page. Furthermore, the slider on the add commute page does not consider the spatial layout of elements in relation to the user’s gestures. This error is not prevented by the system image, so the user feels frustrated when an error occurs at the fault of the app.</dd> -->
				</ol>
				<p>Our plan was to tackle the <b>usability issues</b> of being <b>unable to recover from errors</b> as well as the <b>poor help and documentation</b>.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Before and After: Redesigns</h2>
				<img src="images/redesign1.png" class="responsive center" style="width:80%">
				<ol> 
				  <li><b>(?) buttons</b></li>
				  <dd>- These buttons were implemented to improve the help and documentation of the summary page. When opened, it will inform the user about how they compare to the global emission average and how each category was calculated.</dd>
				  <li><b>Emission units</b></li>
				  <dd>- The ‘L’ represents liters, but user testing revealed that it was <b>ambiguous</b>, so we relabeled the emission score to be measured in lbs CO2. Pounds also seemed to be the most common measurement of carbon emissions, so we wanted to be consistent with that.</dd>
				  <li><b>You’ve Saved Section</b></li>
				  <dd>- To increase the user’s motivation to use our app, we included a section that informs the user about how their actions have a direct, positive impact on the environment.</dd>
				  <li><b>Navigation Bar</b></li>
				  <dd>- Feedback from user testing revealed that users have <b>no interest in the profile page</b>, and we agreed to omit this page because it did not help with motivating the user and was limited in functionality. The <b>icon of the summary page</b> was changed from a footprint to a page report because users found the footprint ambiguous. It represented a carbon footprint, but carbon footprints are not really mentioned in the app as much as carbon emissions. We figured that a page report would align more with the function of the summary page.</dd>
				</ol>
				<img src="images/redesign2.png" class="responsive center" style="width:80%">
				<ol> 
				  <li><b>Title of Page</b></li>
				  <dd>- The name of the data being recorded was placed at the top of the page to remind users of what they are logging.</dd>
				  <li><b>Input Miles</b></li>
				  <dd>- From A/B testing, we made the miles input a text box to improve user freedom.</dd>
				  <li><b>Cancel Button</b></li>
				  <dd>- Including a cancel button improves the user’s ability to diagnose and recover from errors (of navigating to the wrong page or inputting dissatisfactory data). Furthermore, ‘save’ and ‘cancel’ felt like <b>more congruent language</b> than ‘save’ and ‘back.’</dd>
				</ol>
			<br>
			<h2>Final Design</h2>
				<img src="images/finaldesign.png" class="responsive center" style="width:110%">
			<br>
			<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As a member of the eco tracker team, I learned how rewarding collaboration can be when everyone on the team shares the same goals. None of us had a specific role (i.e. designer, project manager, coder, etc.). Rather, we each did our best to get equal exposure to every aspect of the project, and we helped each other whenever we could not solve something. I believe that this was very successful because no one was stressed with one burden, and everyone could use their strengths to contribute to the project.</p>
				<p>If given more time and resources, we would publicize eco tracker and make it available to more users. We would also work with companies and organizations that track carbon emissions, such as the <a style="color:#6ab86a" href="https://www.footprintnetwork.org/about-us/">Global Footprint Network</a>, to determine whether there has been a change in the global average upon launching our app. Our app would be successful if more people are aware of their carbon footprint and if there is a notable reduction in carbon emissions.</p>
