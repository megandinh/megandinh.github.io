Over a table crammed with bowls and beer bottles, the adults are always engaged in \n          lively chatter over the latest gossip, the best deals, and the whereabouts of someone’s children. Those children are no different - \n          playing games and sharing things that we’d never tell our parents. Maybe that’s just how most family gatherings are. We separate ourselves by the \n          language of our conversations and our classification of adult or child (even though all of my cousins, siblings, and I are technically adults now). \n          Actually, what I wanted to do most as a child was</p>\n          \n          <p>Spend more time with my parents. Namely by playing games together. They understandably did not have the patience to learn the rules of Monopoly and \n          encouraged me to play with my siblings, but it made me sad. I just wanted my family to be like the typical American family I saw on TV. As I grew older, \n          I felt a different sadness as I realized how little I knew about</p>\n\n          <p>My parents and my heritage. By the time I graduated college, all of my grandparents passed away. I felt like I lost a major part of my past after my bà ngoại’s \n          recent passing. How desperately and regretfully I wish I could ask them about their lives. To recover this lost generation, I look to my parents who carry on their \n          stories and the Vietnamese community who share theirs in art, books, poetry, and food. Here, I found beauty in my family’s being and courage from my ancestors who \n          endured history and survived.</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div id=\"tablerow\">\n        <div id=\"casetitle\">About</div>\n          <p><i>And you?</i>&#20; is what you say to reciprocate the question that someone asked you first. It’s also the name of a game for families, friends, and anyone who \n          has felt disconnected from their heritage due to assimilation, language barriers, and/or generational differences. With 18 questions in both English and \n          Vietnamese, I dream of a future where we can play a game together - engaging in conversations as equals, being curious about each other, and connecting our pasts, \n          presents, and futures in the stories we share.</p>\n\n          <p>A future where we tend the garden that grew from the seeds of our stories.</p>\n\n          <a id=\"casetext\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/19OHXISFq6QzNDxyRhGnmLo0SgAtq_VfV/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n            (Read more about the program)</a>\n      </div>\n\n       <div id=\"tablerow\">\n        <img id=\"art\" src={display} alt=\"Display at exhibit\"/>\n      </div>\n\n\n      <p>.・。.・゜✭・.・✫・゜・。.</p>\n\n      <div id=\"tablerow\">\n        <div id=\"casetitle\">Visual designs</div>\n        <p>The gradual consumption of a longan fruit with hues of red, white, and blue from the American flag.</p>\n        <img id=\"art\" src={deck} alt=\"Case and card designs\"/>\n      </div>\n\n      <div id=\"tablerow\">\n        <div id=\"casetitle\">Past</div>\n        <p>Encased in a shell.
