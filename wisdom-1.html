						<strong>Failure is fine.</strong> Design is about details, but this can breed a pressuring practice of perfectionism. Nothing is permanent, so try the best you can with what you have. You don't need to detract your sense of mastery over a mistake, and your worth is not measured by your performance. Rejection stings, regardless of its source. The Tylenol you can take for this takes the form of compassion for yourself. Don't beat yourself up for failure or ridicule yourself for your past efforts. Eventually, you'll fail enough to learn how you can rebound faster. "Start early, start often" is synonymous with "fail early, fail often."
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Reframe your T-shape trauma.</strong> It’s difficult to determine what you’re good at and what you want to specialize in when you’re still navigating all the aspects of design. People give you advice to determine your major before your 2nd year or figure out what you want to do with your life fast. It’s practical, but pressuring. Rather than worrying about what that spike is, just keep moving forward. You don’t have to limit yourself to one area of focus - it might even change with time. I think you have the most conviction when you’re challenging yourself to try something new and actively seek ways to learn and improve with each additional interest. Swap your language of “diluted” and “shallow” with “flexible” and "curious.”
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You are not alone.</strong> It would be naive to say that you got here through hard work alone. You stand on the shoulders of friends, family, mentors, peers, and professors, who have supported you when you felt lost and lonely. The kind words of a few can help push you forward in powerful ways, so lean on your support system and recognize the people who have helped you.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Have conversations with other people.</strong> It’s easy to feel jealous or inadequate when you see adorned LinkedIn profiles and buffed resumes, but that is a meticulously curated, singular story. There’s power in listening to someone’s whole story and finding bits of yourself reflected in their narration. If someone who was once in your shoes could find a way to meet their goals, you can too. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You’re not behind or an imposter,</strong> but you feel that way. That’s ok. There’s a pressure to learn a certain way, get a sufficient amount of experience,  or complete your degree in a specific order. I feel reassured when I’m told that anything worth doing is worth doing badly. Start small and go at your own pace. Life isn’t linear, and learning is a process, not an outcome. Something brought you here, so let this happening take you somewhere.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Everything in your life has prepared you for this.</strong> Not to say that your destiny is to become a product designer, but your experience outside design enriches your perspective and your work. From listening to others, supporting your friends, studying psychology, taking theater classes, reading memoirs, and drawing for fun, you’ve found ways to apply your experiences to design. There’s no right way to stumble upon design, nor is there a singular way to interact with it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>You matter.</strong> Your ideas, your creations, and your perspectives matter. There is plenty of space in this world for you to pursue what you want and be appreciated.
